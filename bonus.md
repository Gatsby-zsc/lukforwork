# BONUES PART

## Login-page

- In the login page we have add the button and function of "remember me", which is used for users to not have to enter the account&password again when they have logged once.

## Homepage

- In the Menu bar, we have added the "Home" button, which is used for users to get back to the homepage when they turned to the personal profile. We think this is important when we have open lots of users profiles.
- In the sidebar, we have added the outline of personal info of the loginUser. You can easily click on the name to turn into the personal info page too. Which is much more easy to navigate.
- We have added the "LurkForWork New", which is to get the post header according to the post date. Which is more convenient for users to browser something.
- In case the user has watched plenty of other users and have scroll down to browser mangy posts, we have set the "BACK TO TOP" button, which is to help users to return back to the top of the homepage.

## Update profile & Comment

- We added the function of hide or show users password when they try to change their personal info. This is important for information security.
- We make the "Make-comment" function integrated into each post. So the users can easily make a comment for the post they are currently browsering with no need to scroll to any other place.

## Overall

- Our UI design adheres to a simple and practical style, with each section having clear functionality and optimized based on the existing foundation. For example, when Update Profile and Make Post are activated, the focus is on the rendered box on the screen, and the UI design includes the Upload Image button, Post button, and Close button. We have also prepared default avatars for each user.
- In UX design, the functionality we mentioned up aims to provide users with a better experience when browsing our website, allowing them to navigate and locate more easily and freely explore the parts they want to discover on the webpage.
- We use semantic contents for the buttons and input placeholders. Additionally, we have added a large number of popup error alerts to allow users to precisely locate the errors they have made in their operations.
